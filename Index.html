      Happy Birthday to one of the most amazing people I’ve met! 💫<br><br>
      It still feels unreal that what started as a random chat on Telegram two years ago turned into such a beautiful friendship. Meeting you in person recently made me realize how genuine and kind you truly are — your warmth and the way you welcomed me will always stay with me.<br><br>
      You deserve all the happiness in the world today and always. May your birthday be filled with laughter, love, and moments that make your heart full. Thank you for being such a wonderful part of my life. 💐💖<br><br>
